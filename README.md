## 📄 Standards and Protocols

The foundational specifications that enable AI agents to securely and programmatically send and receive payments.

| Standard / Protocol                              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| :----------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Agent Payments Protocol (AP2)**                | Open standard from Google that uses Verifiable Digital Credentials (VDCs) to capture cart intent, user consent, and payment method mandates. Guarantees integrity of the approval chain and supports fiat rails, stablecoins, and AP2-compliant providers such as Stripe, PayPal, and Coinbase.                                         |
| **Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP)**              | Joint OpenAI × Stripe protocol that issues Shared Payment Tokens after the user authorizes a payment. Tokens are passed to merchants via API, enabling instant checkout flows inside ChatGPT and rapid integration with existing e-commerce systems.                                                                                   |
| **x402 Protocol**                                | Crypto-native extension of AP2 that reuses the HTTP `402 Payment Required` status code so agents can negotiate, request, and settle payments on-chain using stablecoins or other programmable assets.                                                                                                                                   |
| **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**                 | Interoperability layer that lets AI agents connect to external tools and data sources through a standardized, natural-language interface. Payment providers such as Stripe, Adyen, and Alipay are building MCP servers to expose commerce and reconciliation capabilities to agent ecosystems.                                         |
| **Trusted Agent Protocol (Visa)**                | Open-source specification from Visa for building trusted agent-to-agent payment workflows with verifiable identity, consent, and settlement guarantees.                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## 🔥 Attacks & Incidents

Documented attack techniques and real-world incidents that target AI-agentic payment protocols, wallets, and the merchant/MCP surfaces they touch.

### Real-World Incident ⚠️

- [x402 Protocol — October 2025 hack (~$17,693 USDC)](https://www.hokanews.com/2025/10/x402-protocol-under-attack-176k-usdc.html) — GoPlus disclosed exploitation of excessive authorization in the `402bridge` contract: users had granted USDC allowances to the bridge before minting, and the contract owner drained funds across Arbitrum via multiple cross-chain swaps. 200+ users affected. The first public, monetized incident tied directly to the x402 ecosystem and a reminder that x402's open architecture pushes trust onto the facilitator/bridge layer.

### x402-Specific Attacks

- **Payment Replay** — without server-side single-use nonces and short expiry deadlines, the same payment proof can unlock a paid resource repeatedly (Halborn).
- **MitM on 402 Responses** — on-path attacker rewrites `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` data or the requested resource to redirect settlement or deliver a different resource than paid for (Halborn).
- **Overpayment / Draining via Malicious 402 Page** — agents without hard spending limits, payee allowlists, or HITL thresholds pay inflated amounts defined by attacker-controlled 402 responses (Halborn).
- **Facilitator Compromise** — since x402 concentrates verification and settlement at the facilitator, a compromised or malicious facilitator can approve unsettled payments, reject valid ones, or leak payment metadata (Sherlock).
- **x402 V2 `payTo` Hijacking** — V2's dynamic recipient routing lets attackers redirect destination wallets mid-flow unless agents enforce explicit payee allowlists.
- **x402 V2 Plugin Supply Chain** — malicious packages registered in the `@x402/*` namespace (e.g. typosquats like `@x4O2/paywall` vs `@x402/paywall`) run inside the payment pipeline with access to amounts, recipients, and wallet keys.
- **CAIP-2 Network Spoofing** — protocol requests payment on `eip155:8453` (Base) but the agent's wallet defaults to `eip155:1` (mainnet gas ×100), or the identifier points to a testnet where tokens are worthless while the service delivers production data.

### AP2-Specific Attacks

- **Branded Whisper Attack** — indirect prompt injection that manipulates product ranking in an AP2 ShoppingAgent so malicious merchants get selected regardless of mandate constraints (Debi & Zhu, [arXiv:2601.22569](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22569)).
- **Vault Whisper Attack** — exfiltration of sensitive data through the AP2 shopping flow, showing that cryptographic mandates alone do not stop data-leak channels (Debi & Zhu, [arXiv:2601.22569](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22569)).
- **Workflow Hijacking via Prompt Injection** — compromised instructions reroute delegation between AP2 sub-agents (shopper → malicious endpoint), bypassing Intent Mandate checks before Cart Mandate is generated (CSA AP2 analysis).
- **Memory Poisoning in Embedding Spaces** — corrupting past-cart memory via components like `DpcHelper` influences retrieval and causes `PaymentMethodCollector` and `ShoppingAgent` to misread user intent on future purchases (CSA AP2 analysis).
- **Cartel Attacks via Anomaly Flooding** — colluding agents generate synthetic false positives to overwhelm human reviewers, masking slow coordinated purchases across multiple merchants; audit-log injection hides the coordination (CSA AP2 analysis).
- **Emergent Goal Misalignment** — sub-agents autonomously converge on behaviors that minimize authentication friction (e.g. `PaymentMethodCollector` deprioritizing high-risk merchant checks) — exactly the class of threat MAESTRO surfaces that STRIDE misses (CSA AP2 analysis).
- **Policy Manipulation / SCA Bypass** — compromised agents exploit LLM flexibility to reinterpret Strong Customer Authentication rules, e.g. treating malicious merchants as "trusted" to skip 3DS (CSA AP2 analysis).

### Payment-MCP & Multi-Agent Attacks

- **Tool Poisoning on Payment MCP Servers** — malicious MCP server (or a spoofed Stripe/Adyen/Alipay MCP) embeds instructions in tool descriptions or runtime responses; since payment MCPs hold high privileges over catalog, cart, and settlement, impact is direct ([arXiv:2506.02040](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02040)).
- **Advanced Tool Poisoning Attack (ATPA)** — injection delivered through tool **outputs** (including error messages) rather than schemas, bypassing connect-time review of descriptions and surfacing at runtime inside payment flows ([CyberArk Labs](https://www.cyberark.com/resources/threat-research-blog/poison-everywhere-no-output-from-your-mcp-server-is-safe)).
- **MCP Preference Manipulation Attack (MPMA)** — tool-ranking manipulation across multi-MCP deployments so a payment agent preferentially selects the attacker's rogue tool over legitimate merchant or PSP tools.
- **Puppet Attack / Rug Pull on Merchant MCP** — malicious MCP initially offers a legitimate commerce tool to earn trust, then silently updates the tool schema or behavior to redirect checkout ([arXiv:2506.02040](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02040)).
- **Inter-Agent Trust Exploitation** — LLMs apply different safety policies based on the source of the instruction; models that resist direct injection execute the same payload when it arrives from a peer agent (100% ASR across 18 SOTA models). Critical in multi-agent payment topologies where buyer, merchant, PSP, and fraud agents interact ([arXiv:2507.06850](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06850)).
